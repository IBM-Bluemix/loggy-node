<!-- add more logging! -->

It's very often the case that when a Bluemix app doesn't work the way you
expect it to, you don't have any idea **WHY** it doesn't work the way you
expect it to.  My typical reaction, when this is occurs to me, is ...
**add more logging!**

errors often occur during initialization
